"""Tests for the CLI `/reasoning reveal` post-hoc reasoning display.

`/reasoning reveal` shows the reasoning text captured from the last turn.
`/reasoning reveal --limit N` shows only the last N reasoning blocks.

These assert:
- Empty state when no reasoning is stored.
- Full replay when reasoning is stored and no --limit is given.
- Truncation to the last N blocks when --limit N is given.
- Rejection of invalid --limit values (0, negative, non-numeric, missing N).
- Rejection of unknown arguments after `reveal`.
- Registration in the command registry.
